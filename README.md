# ultrasonic-sensor-blocks
Ultrasonic Sensor code blocks for use in mBlock Arduino programming environment (based on Scratch 2.0).  Fork of arduino-new-ping (GNU GPL v3).

This includes a copy of the Arduino New Ping library written by Tim Eckel.  It is based off of commit 44589954410e4ec741a60c6fa7a6f4e07939e536, the last copy published under GNU GPL v3.  Found here:

This will be published as an mBlock extension which wraps the Arduino library in Scratch 2.0-style visual programming blocks.
